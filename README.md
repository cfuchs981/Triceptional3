# Triceptional 3

This android app contains a daily food diary, a tab window to hold workouts for each muscle group, and another extra page to track
progress reports. 

## Getting Started

Since this app was just an experiment to work with the AndroidStudio developing environment, it was never officially packaged and distributed. Meaning to get a copy onto your device, it requires actually opening in android studio and loading an unofficial test onto a connected machine. 

### Prerequisites

Because of the status of the project, it does require AndroidStudio to run. 

### Installing

To use this application, just download the entire zipped file and import it into your android development environment. 

## Built With

* [AndroidStudio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) - developer environment 

## Acknowledgments

* Just as a note: this really was just an experiment to learn how apps were made in AndroidStudio, and mainly with how Java 
GUI carried over to mobile development. Meaning this code isn't necessarily pretty or made with good practices in mind such and so forth, 
so by no means take this as serious app. At the very least, it accomplishes what it was set to do.
